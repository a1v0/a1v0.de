- go to Studio
- select ANY application
- do full code search
- it'll search through all script fields in all applications

Wouldn't it be useful to have a way to search through all the code in ServiceNow? How much easier would it make life if we were able to search every script field in every table in every scope?

Well, good news! There's a way and it's super easy.
