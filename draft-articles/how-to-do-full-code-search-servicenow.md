- go to Studio
- select ANY application
- do full code search
- it'll search through all script fields in all applications

Wouldn't it be useful to have a way to search through all the code in ServiceNow? How much easier would it make life if we were able to search every script field in every table in every scope?

Well, good news! There's a way and it's super easy.

## Performing a platform-wide code search

To begin, navigate to **System Applications > Studio**. The Studio should open in a new tab and a modal window will appear asking you to select or create an application.

Select any applicationâ€”it makes no different which one. The modal should automatically disappear and you will be left on a page that says "Welcome to Studio".

In the top right corner, there's a button called "Code Search". Click it and a modal will appear.

Now, simply type your search term, check the box "Search in all applications", and you're ready to go!

In a few seconds, you'll have search results from all script fields in the platform, including front-end stuff like Widgets.

You're welcome!
