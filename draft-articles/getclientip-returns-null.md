- outline problem: you need IP but it only returns null
- why? I'm not 100% sure, but it's probably because certain code runs asynchronously and thus doesn't have access to your current session, or because the GlideSession isn't fully built at the point getClientIP is being run
- solution:
    - IP address stored in two places: sys_user_login_history and syslog_transaction
    - give pros and cons of each approach
    - advise against using syslog_transaction

If you're running a script in which you need to know the IP address of the current session, but all you're getting is `null`, then keep reading.

This article explains why `gs.getSession().getClientIP()` returns `null` under specific circumstances. It also offers a potential workaround.

> The `getClientIP()` method basically always works, with few, specific exceptions. When it fails, it returns `null`.
