- outline problem: you need IP but it only returns null
- why? I'm not 100% sure, but it's probably because certain code runs asynchronously and thus doesn't have access to your current session, or because the GlideSession isn't fully built at the point getClientIP is being run
- solution:
    - IP address stored in two places: sys_user_login_history and syslog_transaction
    - give pros and cons of each approach
    - advise against using syslog_transaction
