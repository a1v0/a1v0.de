You want a custom redirect on your platform. You have configured `SPEntryPage` and have added appropriate system properties to make it work. But it's not working! Are you trying to login with SSO? Then keep reading!

> The `SPEntryPage` script doesn't run when a user logs into a ServiceNow instance via SSO.

The reason your beautifully crafted login script isn't executing is that SSO login overrides all sorts of ordinary login behaviours.

(Other non-normal login methods, e.g. LDAP login, aren't affected and `SPEntryPage` should behave as normal there.)
