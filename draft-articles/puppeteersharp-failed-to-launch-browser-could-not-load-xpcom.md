- Puppeteer error when using Firefox
- main error message: Failed to launch browser
- subheading: couldn't load XPCOM
- solution: install GTK3 (at least for Linux. unsure about Windows)
- `sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev`

When using PuppeteerSharp with Firefox, you may encounter this error message: "Failed to launch browser", with a subheading of "Couldn't load XPCOM".

This error seems to come about because of a missing or outdated software package called [GTK3](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4215166), which is something that draws widgets for Linux window managers etc. Update to GTK3 and you'll be right as rain.

This is the Linux command to install it:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
```

From a quick Google search, I can see that users on Windows as well as Linux can have this issue. I regrettably don't know whether there's an equivalent Windows fix.

What [XPCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPCOM) has to do with the whole thing is not clear to me.
