- intro
  - unable to access instance via local login following removal of dummy data
  - (SSO and web service users aren't affected because they don't use this login page)
- when does it happen?
  - removal of dummy data (via Support portal)
  - theme is customised (possibly linked to Theme Builder but I'm not sure)
  - MFA is enabled
  - you will know it is happening because the logo you've configured is appearing as a broken link in the login screen
- what actually happens?
  - logo is missing
  - absent logo causes a redirect to fail, leading to a loop
- how to solve
  - if you have SSO enabled, login via SSO
    - if you're completely locked out of the instance, contact NOW support for assistance
  - re-upload the logo file to the system, then copy sys_id of that file
  - open system Properties and search for `glide.product.image`. In this property should be a file name of `[sys_id].iix`
  - Replace the value of that sys_id with `[copied sys_id].iix`
  - Now all should be working
- more info
  - supposedly it's a bug frmo San Dieago
  - given that, it seems surprising that it's been happening to me (Vancouver user)
