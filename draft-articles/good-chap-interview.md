- intro
  - admittedly it's a clickbaity title
  - tech sector is big
  - Silicon Valley firms give it an air of inclusivity
  - moreover coding is seen as a type of meritocratic heaven, where things like class and social skills don't matter
    - anyone is welcome, so long as they can show eagerness and skill
- in reality, this isn't the case at many places
  - disclaimer: don't want to say most, but then I also don't just want to say some
