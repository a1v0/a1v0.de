- install NVim
- lazy.vim is the package manager, as opposed to the now deprecated Packer
- explain how it doesn't matter too much which file you write to, so long as it's a Lua file
  - give example structures that a user could follow:
    - disabled.lua or color_schemes.lua or just dump everything into the main one
- syntax for doing it
- common flags, e.g. "enabled = false" etc.
