ServiceNow runs on SQL. Everybody knows that. But nobody should ever see any SQL on the platform. After all, isn't the entire purpose of ServiceNow to prevent us from needing to use SQL?

So why do we sometimes get SQL errors in the ServiceNow system logs? And what should I do to prevent them?

## Why do we get SQL errors?

ServiceNow is a clever frontend to a database. As such, it should be battle-tested enough to prevent any SQL errors from happening. The good news is that it _is_ good enough for that.

The problem is that it is also a highly configurable platform, giving us all manner of freedoms. The SQL errors are usually caused by bits of logic added by customers.

In practice, SQL errors happen when database operations run in parallel and create some sort of conflict. For example, you may have a business rule doing one thing and a Flow or Workflow in the background is also running against the same table or record.

> SQL errors often happen when multiple bits of logic run at the same time, e.g. Flows, Workflows and business rules. Check for any such conflicts when you encounter SQL errors.
