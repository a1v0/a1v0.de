- problem: need to log in to generate a token
- can be impossible if security settings on third party don't allow
- solution: there isn't one, aside from using basic auth. This article is simply there to confirm that, at time of writing, there's no workaround and ServiceNow doesn't recognise it as a problem. they consider it a security feature.
    - while it does double down on security, it is inconvenient when you're trying to connect securely to a trusted third party

When setting up a connection to a third-party ServiceNow instance via OAuth, you will need to generate a token. This process requires you to log into the third party instance from your local instance.

In many cases, this causes no issues. However, many larger corporate clients have thick layers of cyber-security wedged in between their IT estate and the outside world. This can make token generation difficult.
