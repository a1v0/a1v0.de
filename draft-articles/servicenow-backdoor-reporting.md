- intro
- summary of problem
  - dot-walking (explain term) allows you to access data that you oughtn't see
- context
  - how ACLs work in reports
    - report_on vs report_view
    - mention how neither is ideal and they feel like an afterthought
    - 'before query' business rule does all the heavy lifting
      - before query rules are much messier than ACLs: an ACL simply has to return true or false whereas business rules need to make use of GlideRecord
- for whom is it an issue
  - basically for anyone who has any even remotely sophisticated set of scripted ACLs
  - anyone who needs to block 'high-ranking' users, e.g. admin and itil, from seeing stuff.
- how to reproduce
  - provide screenshots
- how has the problem come about?
  - mention how the funny report ACLs and the security flaw are a natural consequence of GlideAggregate and aggregate queries in general
