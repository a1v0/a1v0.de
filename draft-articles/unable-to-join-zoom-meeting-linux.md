ich musste viele Versionen zurueckgehen, aber es funktioniert.

A common problem with Zoom on Linux is that you install it, but you somehow can't join a meeting. No meeting room is showing once you click a meeting link. However, when you close the application, you're asked whether you want to leave the meeting.

On top of this, every time you open the app, you're asked to accept Zoom Workplace's terms of service.

This problem affects users on a variety of distros and desktop environments. I haven't worked out what causes it, but I know how to solve it!
