I've plenty to say about the UPS Shipping API and will post a few articles about it on this site. It's all pretty unwieldy, for sure.

But to begin with, here's a pretty fundamental problem with the UPS website:

> The UPS website is designed for Chrome and doesn't work correctly in other browsers.

I was having trouble using the [contact form](https://www.ups.com/upsemail/input?loc=en_GB). It wouldn't let me submit it properly. This is the _main contact form_ on the website, and it doesn't work properly.

Turns out that UPS's antiquated website only works properly on Google Chrome. When I spoke to a UPS tech support rep, they told me the site doesn't work on Firefox, as though it were a perfectly normal thing to say.

Personally, I find this an unforgivable oversight. A contact form, of all things, should work properly on _any_ browser. It's a website user's last resort, when all else has failed (and a _lot_ has failed on the UPS site&mdash;trust me!). A contact form that doesn't work makes toiling with UPS's clunky online infrastructure even more Kafkaesque than it already is.

Moreover, a functional contact form is not exactly a difficult thing to achieve. I've no idea what UPS has done to make its form work only on Chrome, but, whatever it is, there's certainly a better way they could have done it!

Chrome is [by far the dominant browser](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide) in the desktop world, but there are at least two reasons why this shouldn't make a difference to UPS:

1. At time of writing, Chrome has a market share on desktop of just shy of just under 65%. This leaves just over 35% of people who don't use Chrome. They're excluding a fat chunk of the population.
2. Not everybody has access to Chrome. For instance, many company-issued computers restrict the software available to employees, and you may not be able to install Chrome on your machine. (I've been stuck with Edge and Internet Explorer(!) often enough.)

I don't think it can be emphasised too strongly how much of a poor show this is. You really can do better, UPS!
