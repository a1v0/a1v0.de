You've configured your Contextual Search functionality in ServiceNow and it seems to be working. But something's not quite right: "Why is it only showing me some of the results I'm expecting?" you might ask yourself.

There are two main reasons for this, assuming that you have configured the Contextual Search feature correctly.

Make sure that the thing you are expecting to see in the contextual search is visible to the user(s) who are affected by the issue.
