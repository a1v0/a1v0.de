- problem: RIS can only handle one remote connection
  - this is hard-coded into the Flow Actions, annoyingly
  - caveat: the solution here is a generic EXPORT action (Export record using import set) and doesn't necessarily work with other actions
    - also doesn't work for generic import action
      - to get it to work, you need Integration Hub Pro or Enterprise and access to Data Streams. Otherwise you'll not be able to a) see what the Action actually does and b) to edit the action
    - Spoke is inconsistently designed
    - add consolation that the Spoke is pretty darned simple and can easily be made from scratch
- solution:
  - preface: make sure you do everything in the correct scope
  - clone flow actions, add in a variable for Connection Alias
  - update any reference to the flow action
