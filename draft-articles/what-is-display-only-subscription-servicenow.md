Assistance Requested:
You can see in your Subscriptions that you have a display-only licence for Agile 2.0. You would like to know what means Display only.

The terminology "Display only" in Subscription Module means that this particular product does not offer any measurement support. The product is just there for your acknowledgement that it's part of your purchase licensed subscription, however the measurement for such product is not supported. Thus we categorize such products as "Display only".
