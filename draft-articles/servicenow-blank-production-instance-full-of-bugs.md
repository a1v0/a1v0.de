article about how servicenow prod environments aren't seeded like non-prod

- intro
  - what is a seed file
  - prod instance seem to get seeded differently to non-prod
  - caveat: any issues mentioned in this article might be fixed by the time you read it
- problem
  - basically, a bunch of important OOB config is missing
  - major example: Flows are unable to run by default in fresh prod instances
    - a flaw that's incredibly hard to debug
    - requires you to do a bunch of manual stuff
    - especially unhelpful since a) not being able to run flows is a pretty major flaw and b) go-lives are very stressful as it is
