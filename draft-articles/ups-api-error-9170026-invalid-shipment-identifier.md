While building an integration with the UPS Shipping API, we encountered error **9170026 "Invalid shipment identifier."**, which is not documented anywhere on the internet.

Moreover, there's no field within the API that stands out as something that could be called a "shipment identifier". There's `PackageID`, I suppose, but that doesn't seem right.

I contacted UPS and engaged in a long back-and-forth, until we finally got to the bottom of the problem.

## Customs forms on international shipments

UPS's customs forms are confusing and deviate (as far as I know!) from the norm. Ordinarily, all international shipments require some sort of CN22 form.

However, here's the reply from UPS: "the CN22 form type can only be used with Mail Innovations and SurePost services."

> For UPS, the CN22 form is valid only for Mail Innovations and SurePost services. For most other things, Commercial Invoice is the form to choose.

The inclusion of a CN22 object in your Shipping API payload triggers the error. UPS recommends using the **Commercial Invoice** form instead.
