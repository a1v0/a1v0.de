While building an integration with the UPS Shipping API, we encountered error **9170026 "Invalid shipment identifier."**, which is not documented anywhere on the internet.

Moreover, there's no field within the API that stands out as something that could be called a "shipment identifier". There's `PackageID`, I suppose, but that doesn't seem right.

I contacted UPS and engaged in a long back-and-forth, until we finally worked out the issue.
