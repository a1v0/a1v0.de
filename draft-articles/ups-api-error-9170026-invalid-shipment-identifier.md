While building an integration with the UPS Shipping API, we encountered error **9170026 "Invalid shipment identifier."**, which is not documented anywhere on the internet.

Moreover, there's no field within the API that stands out as something that could be called a "shipment identifier". There's `PackageID`, I suppose, but that doesn't seem right.

> If you encounter an unknown error message like this one, the support email to contact is **<apisupport@ups.com>**. If you find any good new info, [get in touch](/contact) and I can add it here.
