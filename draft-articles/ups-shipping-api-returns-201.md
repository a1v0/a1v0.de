This is just a quick note about the UPS Shipping API (though I've got more to say about UPS &ndash; watch this space). The [documentation](https://developer.ups.com/api/reference?loc=en_US#operation/Shipment) has many flaws, one of which is that it gives you the wrong HTTP response code for a successful API call.

> The UPS shipping API responds with `201`, not `200`.

The docs suggest that the UPS Shipping API returns `200` when a successful request is given. In fact, the response is `201`.

Any tests that assert that the returned status is `200` will therefore fail. If you're careless (like me, alas), you might not notice for a while that your request is successful, despite a failing Jest test suite.

I attribute this error simply to carelessness on UPS's part. I'd feel less upset by it if it were a small startup or a private project, because mixing up `200` and `201` is easily done. But the fact that the error hasn't been spotted in UPS's documentation shows a lack of care and attention.
