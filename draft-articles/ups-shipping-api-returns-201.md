The UPS Shipping API is an unwieldy beast. The documentation [INCLUDE LINK] leaves a lot to be desired and is a source of constant frustration for developers, and the tech support UPS offers is even worse. For such an enormous company with so many resources available, and such a small number of APIs, I really felt that they could do so, _so_ much better.

This page lists things I have learned while using UPS's website, its API and its documentation, in the hope that others might be spared some of the troubles I underwent.

## 2. The Shipping API returns `201`, not `200`

The docs suggest that the UPS Shipping API returns `200` when a successful request is given. In fact, the response is `201`.

Any tests that assert that the returned status is `200` will therefore fail. If you're careless (like me, alas), you might not notice for a while that your request is successful, despite a failing Jest test suite.

I attribute this error simply to carelessness on UPS's part. I'd feel less upset by it if it were a small startup or a private project, because mixing up `200` and `201` is easily done. But the fact that the error hasn't been spotted in UPS's documentation shows a lack of care.
