I am always perturbed that ServiceNow has never published any real guidance on cloning. In theory, it's an easy process, but reality typically gets in the way.

This clone guide is for anybody who is cloning instances that contain in-flight configuration that has not yet been approved for release. It's intended as a starting point: your instance might contain plugins that require special treatment, for example.

If you have any suggestions or corrections, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](/contact).
