In theory, if the `knowledge` field is set to `true` on a ServiceNow Problem record, then a draft knowledge article will be created on resolution of the problem.

In practice, this doesn't happen out of the box (as of the Washington release).

## The solution

The cause is simply an incorrect trigger condition on a business rule on the Problem table called "Problem Create Knowledge".

Out of the box, the condition on which the script should run is:

```js
current.problem_state.changesTo(4) && current.knowledge == true
```

This condition is incorrect, because there is no `sys_choice` value of `4` for Problem's `problem_state` field. Instead, the relevant state value is `107`:

```js
current.problem_state.changesTo(107) && current.knowledge == true
```
