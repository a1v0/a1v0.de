I was recently faced with a user story that required me to ensure that a certain application was installed on our ServiceNow instance. Easy enough. However, the story specific a minimum version.

I went to the Plugins module and saw that the application was installed, but I couldn't see which version I had.

The App Store was no help either.

- Go to plugins module
- Click “Switch to Classic App Manager” in top right
- Search for your app
- Don’t be fooled by the version number on the right: click the dropdown menu and look for the version that has “[installed]” next to it.
