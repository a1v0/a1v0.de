- this article uses Authorization Code grant type
- you're sure that the auth code is correct
- the token auth_code_lifespan field is set to 60 by default within the app registry
- it's possible that you're taking longer than 60 seconds to create the curl request, leading to access_denied

This article presents a potential solution to a `401` response when you attempt to generate an OAuth bearer token in ServiceNow.

Specifically, my solution works for when you are using the Authorization Code grant type.

Here's what's happening:

0. You're generating your authorization code correctly.
1. You're making a request via Curl or through a tool like Postman.
2. You receive a `401` error and a JSON payload that looks like this:

```json
{
    "error_description": "access_denied",
    "error": "server_error"
}
```
