- WSL: install it on a Windows directory, but make sure your qmk_firmware folder is on WSL, else it'll be really slow
- notes on flashing

I recently purchased a Lily58 from [Mechboards](https://mechboards.co.uk/). I was about to embark on a typing journey from which I haven't looked back.

When I first received the keyboard, though, I couldn't work out how to flash it. It was a struggle to find a guide that clearly explains what to do, so here's my guide for you!

## Whom this guide is for

This guide is for anybody with a Lily58 keyboard with Pro Micro controllers, where the controllers have a "RESET" button.

If you don't have these things, my solution may still work, but I can't say for sure.

## Installing QMK

First, you'll need to [install QMK](https://msys.qmk.fm/guide). I initially installed regular Windows QMK, but it was extremely slow. I switched to QMK for WSL which worked much better.

Install QMK WSL in your normal Windows system (not on WSL). However, make sure that your `qmk_firmware` is situated in WSL. If not, your keymap compilations will take _forever_.
