use this as a guide: <https://makersinstitute.gitbooks.io/c-basics/content/arrays/custom-sorting.html>

- explain how C# uses an interface
- just add suitable comparer method to your class and C# will know what to do when you use Array.Sort()
- what if my class already inherits from elsewhere?
  - you can just do ClassName : BaseClass, IInterface

Most, if not all, of C#'s pre-made classes can be sorted in ascending or descending order. In other words, if you make an array full of them, C# will be able to sort them.

But what happens when you create your own class? How can I define my own sorting order?
