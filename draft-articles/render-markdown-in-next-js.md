article about rendering markdown in Next

- marked doesn't sanitise and forces you to use DangerouslySetHTML
- remark-rehypem react-remark etc. don't work well with app routing
- markdown-to-jsx works fine but doesn't support <Link>
- Contentlayer easy to use and does all the heavy lifting.
  - has good docs, too
  - uses DangerouslySet... itself
