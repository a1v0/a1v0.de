Markdown is a wonderful markup language. It is human readable even without being rendered and its limited set of formatting options makes it easy to work with. Its linting rules, moreover, make it a very accessible format. Why wouldn't you, therefore, use Markdown as the backbone of your website's content?

All articles on this website are stored in Markdown format. The trouble is that Markdown needs to be converted into HTML by a renderer. That renderer, in turn, needs to be compatible with Next.js, on which this site is built.

## Which renderer is the right one?

We have a fair few Markdown packages at our disposal to use in Next.js, but they're not all ideal. I went on a journey to find the right one for this site.

- marked doesn't sanitise and forces you to use DangerouslySetHTML
- remark-rehypem react-remark etc. don't work well with app routing
- markdown-to-jsx works fine but doesn't support `<Link>`
- Contentlayer easy to use and does all the heavy lifting.
  - has good docs, too
  - uses DangerouslySet... itself
