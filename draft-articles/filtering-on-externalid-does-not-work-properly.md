- explain what is meant by filtering on externalid
- explain that this would normally work fine if you're using somethinig like user_name or email as externalId
- if you're using a custom field, this causes problems
- workaround, which is suitable for some circumstances, is to prepopulate sys_scim_user table before provisioning
  - obvs not a good long-term solution, just good for one-off pre-provisioning
