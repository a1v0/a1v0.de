In Utah, ServiceNow introduced an _auto-populate_ feature for record producers, enabling you to automatically set the value of a field in a record producer, based on the user's input for a different field.

This is incredibly handy and saves you having to use client scripts with client-callable script includes. (I usually cry into my coffee every time I have to use GlideAjax for something trivial.) Well done ServiceNow!

However, the way the feature has been implemented means that it cannot work on the CSM portal.

> Auto-populate will always fail when users with `snc_external` interect with a record producer.

    CSM
    Auto-populate record producer
    Snc_external users canâ€™t access API
    Will be fixed in Washington, supposedly
