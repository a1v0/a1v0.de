The UPS Shipping API is an unwieldy beast. The documentation [INCLUDE LINK] leaves a lot to be desired and is a source of constant frustration for developers, and the tech support UPS offers is even worse. For such an enormous company with so many resources available, and such a small number of APIs, I really felt that they could do so, _so_ much better.

This page lists things I have learned while using UPS's website, its API and its documentation, in the hope that others might be spared some of the troubles I underwent.

## 3. Non-unique order number field

The Shipping API has numerous fields to store reference numbers. However, most of them expect a unique value.

This is no good if you need to re-use a reference number. For example, if order no. 1234 gets shipped, returned by the customer, then shipped again, you'll probably want to link the second shipment to order no. 1234 fpr your own bookkeeping.

The field to use in this case is `ReferenceNumber/Value`. This will link the shipment to the order number and the order number will normally display on the generated invoice.
