\tableofcontents not showing in latex

Contents shows but the contents of the Contents doesn't
make sure you use the 
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{1.2 Research questions}

syntax if you're using \section*{}

Otherwise, it's often a package that prevents it from working. comment out packages one by one to see what happens (this can be really annoying to do, because you end up with a bunch of compilation errors each time if you don't comment out other bits of content, too)
