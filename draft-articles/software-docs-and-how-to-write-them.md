Artikel über wie wichtig es ist, Docs zu schreiben. Selbst ein paar Bulletpoints während man ein Programm entwickelt, die man dann zum Schluss ergänzt, sind besser als nichts

- intro
  - docs super important
  - so why are we so poor at writing them?
  - we always leave them to the last minute, by which time we've forgotten about half of the features
- why are docs useful
  - training material
    - for you and your colleagues
    - for client at handover
    - for third party API users
  - handover to client
- why docs are a pain to write
  - docs are always out of date if your project is still in its "constantly in flux" phase
  - you're overworked as it is!
- how to write good docs with one simple trick
  - if you, like most people, don't have a dedicated docs-writing team working for you, follow these steps
  - make a document right at the start of the project
  - add bullet point notes of the stuff you need to document as you go along
    - no need to add too much detail, because it might lose its accuracy throughout the dev process
  - periodically review to see which bits of the program are closed off/complete and document them
  - this way, you can get as much documentation out of the way during the dev process as possible and you have a list of remaining bits of content
