- article about updating python version on ubuntu/wsl
- don't do it. use venv instead. give instructions on venv
- explain why not to update (ubuntu comes installed with a particular version of python and a lot of utils run on it)
- ChatGPT might find a way to do it, but it'll cause you problems that you can't undo

Is your Python version on your machine old? Do you want to update it to a specific version? Can't find a good guide online for how to do it?

Well, you've come to the right place! Though, in fact, my advice is: **don't do it!** You will live to regret it.

This article shows you the correct thing to do instead of upgrading, as well as explaining why you shouldn't do it.

Don't ask ChatGPT for a second opinion. It'll probably tell you how to upgrade Python and will consequently cause you a lot of headaches!

> It's not a good idea to try and upgrade your system's Python version. Instead, simulate an upgrade through the use of virtual environments.
