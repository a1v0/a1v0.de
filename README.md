# a1v0.de Website

A simple blog site where I intend to add occasional help articles/notes/explainers about coding problems that don't readily have an answer on Google.

## Colour scheme

I'm modelling my design on simple UK government websites like [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/) and [NHS.UK](https://www.nhs.uk/). This is in part because I find the designs beautiful in their simplicity and in part because I am not much of a designer myself.
