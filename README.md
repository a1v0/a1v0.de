# a1v0.de Website

A simple blog site where I intend to add occasional help articles/notes/explainers about coding problems that don't readily have an answer on Google.

## Colour scheme

I'm modelling my design on simple UK government websites like [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/) and [NHS.UK](https://www.nhs.uk/). This is in part because I find the designs beautiful in their simplicity and in part because I am not much of a designer myself.

[^1]: Cambridge blue

[^2]: While Cambridge blue is basically an open-source colour, this shade of yellow is taken from the Cambridge University Boat Club's [branding](https://cubc.org.uk/app/uploads/2020/08/CUBC-Brand-Guidelines.pdf). Cambridge blue is difficult to match, so I took an existing one. Please contact me if this is not OK.
