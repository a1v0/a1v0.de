title: The UPS website only works on Chrome

I've plenty to say about the UPS Shipping API and will post a few articles about it on this site. It's all pretty unwieldy, for sure.

But to begin with, here's a pretty fundamental problem with the UPS website itself:

> The UPS website is designed for Google Chrome and doesn't work correctly in other browsers.

I was having trouble using the [contact form](https://www.ups.com/upsemail/input?loc=en_GB): it wouldn't let me submit it properly. This is the _main contact form_ on the website, and it doesn't work properly. Oof!

Turns out that UPS's antiquated website only works properly on Google Chrome. When I spoke to a UPS tech support rep in a call-centre in Germany, they told me that the site doesn't work on my beloved Firefox. Moreover, they said it as though it were a perfectly normal thing to say.

I find this an unforgivable oversight. A contact form, of all things, should work properly on _any_ browser. It's a website user's last resort, when all else has failed (and a _lot_ has failed on the UPS site&mdash;trust me!). A contact form that doesn't work makes toiling with UPS's clunky online infrastructure even more Kafkaesque than it already is.

And it's hardly as though a functional contact form is a difficult thing to achieve. I've no idea what UPS has done to make its form work only on Chrome, but, whatever it is, there's certainly a better way they could have done it!

## "But Chrome is so popular!"

Google Chrome is [by far the dominant browser](https://gs.statcounter.com/) in the world, but there are at least two reasons why this shouldn't make a difference to UPS:

1. At time of writing, Chrome has a [market share on desktop](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide) of just under 65%. This leaves just over 35% of people who _don't_ use Chrome. UPS's design choice prevents a fat chunk of the global population from using its site.
2. Not everybody has access to Chrome. For instance, many company-issued computers restrict the software available to employees, and you may not be able to install Chrome on your machine. (I've been stuck with Edge and Internet Explorer(!) often enough.)

## "But I can load the site just fine..."

It's true that I'm using a broken contact form to write off an entire website. However, the fact that the most basic and fundamental of website tools&mdash;the humble contact form&mdash;isn't designed to work outside of Chrome puts the entire website in doubt.

As a Firefox user, I can't be certain that I'm not living in some Platonic cave, in which I'm only experiencing a shadow of the full functionality of the UPS website. The implicit trust between a user and the website of a household-name corporation is broken.

I don't think it can be emphasised too strongly how much of a poor show this is. You really can do better, UPS!
