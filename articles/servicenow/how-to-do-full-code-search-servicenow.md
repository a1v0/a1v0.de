Wouldn't it be wonderful to have a way to search through all the code in ServiceNow? How much easier would it make life if we were able to search every script field in every table in every scope?

Well, good news: there's a way and it's super easy!

> This method works on every recent release of ServiceNow.

To begin, navigate to **System Applications > Studio**. The Studio should open in a new tab and a modal window will appear asking you to select or create an application.

Select _any_ applicationâ€”it makes no different which one. The modal will automatically disappear and you will be left on a page that says "Welcome to Studio".

In the top right corner, there's a button called "Code Search". Click it and a modal will appear.

Now, simply type your search term, check the "Search in all applications" box, and you're ready to go!

In a few seconds, you'll have search results from all script fields in the entire platform, including front-end stuff like Widgets.
