A problem many people eventually face on their instance is that the My Requests widget doesn't show any  requests, even though the user used to be able to see them.

If it's not caused by a widget customisation (woe betide anybody who modifies this widget!), then it's likely that your Employee Center plugin is out of date.

You are most likely to experience this issue following an instance upgrade, because plugins don't always get updated at the same time as the instance. Make sure that the plugin version you are running supports your current instance version.

Once you have updated the Employee Center plugin (and/or ESC Pro), you should experience no further issues.
